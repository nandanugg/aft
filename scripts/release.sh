# release.sh — Tag and push a new AFT release
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/release.sh 0.2.0        # release v0.2.0
#   ./scripts/release.sh 0.2.0 --dry  # preview without committing/pushing
#
# What it does:
#   1. Validates the version is semver
#   2. Checks for clean working tree (no uncommitted changes)
#   3. Syncs version across all 7 package files
#   4. Commits the version bump
#   5. Creates a git tag (v0.2.0)
#   6. Pushes commit + tag to origin
#   7. CI takes over: test → build → publish npm + GitHub release

# ─── Static release-content checks ───
#
# Run BEFORE the dry-run early-exit so `release.sh <ver> --dry` also catches
# missing release notes and stale announcement text. These checks don't
# mutate anything; they're pure read-only validation.
#
# We keep forgetting to update the in-plugin "what's new" dialog for new
# minor releases. The dialog text lives in `ANNOUNCEMENT_VERSION` and
# `ANNOUNCEMENT_FEATURES` constants in both plugin entry files, and it
# only re-fires when `ANNOUNCEMENT_VERSION` is bumped (PLUGIN_VERSION
# alone doesn't trigger it — that's by design so patch releases don't
# spam dismissed dialogs).
#
# Release notes drafts live at `.alfonso/release-notes/v$VERSION.md` per
# the standing workflow rule; CI uses this exact path as the GitHub
# release body. Missing notes mean we'd ship blank GitHub + Discord
# release announcements.
