#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Wait for the GitHub Actions release workflow to complete for a given tag.
# Usage: ./scripts/wait-release.sh v0.7.5 [--max-wait <seconds>] [--no-fail-fast] [--run-id <id>]
# Polls every 5 seconds, exits 0 on success, 1 on failure, 2 on timeout.
#
# Behavior:
#   - Watches BOTH the workflow conclusion AND individual job state. When any
#     non-skipped, non-allowlisted job reaches a failure-class conclusion
#     (failure, cancelled, timed_out, action_required) the script cancels
#     the remaining run, waits for terminal state, and exits 1 with the
#     failing job name. This saves the 15-20 minute tail when one job fails
#     at minute 3 but the other parallel jobs would have kept running.
#   - Allowlist of failure-tolerant jobs is fixed in JOB_FAILURE_ALLOWLIST
#     below — only contains the Discord announcement step, which is
#     intentionally continue-on-error and isn't allowed to roll back a real
#     release.
#   - Use --no-fail-fast to disable cancel-on-first-failure (script will then
#     wait for natural workflow completion regardless of any job failure).
#   - Use --run-id to skip run discovery and watch a known release run ID
#     directly.
#   - Output uses plain newlines so line-buffered pipes flush every status
#     update. Per-job transitions are printed once so callers see progress.
#   - Default max-wait is 35 minutes (2100s). Healthy releases finish in
#     ~13-26 min; 35 min gives headroom for v0.30+ workflows where Windows
#     builds plus npm publish push the total past 25 min. Override with
#     --max-wait or MAX_WAIT_SECONDS env var.
