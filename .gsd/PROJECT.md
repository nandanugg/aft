## What This Is

Agent File Toolkit (AFT) — a Rust binary + OpenCode TypeScript plugin that gives AI coding agents semantic file manipulation and code navigation primitives. Replaces the read-grep-edit-read cycle with operations that match how agents reason about code: edit by symbol name, trace call paths in one call, manage imports with a single operation, checkpoint/restore without git overhead.

Two components: a Rust binary (`aft`) that embeds tree-sitter grammars for 6 languages and does all computation, and a thin TypeScript OpenCode plugin that bridges tool calls to the binary via JSON over stdin/stdout.

## Core Value

One-call semantic file operations that eliminate mechanical token waste — agents edit by symbol name instead of line numbers, read file structure instead of entire files, and trace call chains in a single operation.

## Current State

M001/S01 complete. The `aft` Rust binary runs as a persistent process with NDJSON protocol — accepts commands (ping, version, echo) on stdin, writes JSON responses to stdout, recovers from malformed input, shuts down cleanly on EOF. 17 tests pass (13 unit + 4 integration). LanguageProvider trait defined with stub implementation, ready for S02's tree-sitter backing.

## Architecture / Key Patterns

- **Persistent binary process:** The Rust binary runs as a long-lived process, receiving JSON commands on stdin and writing JSON responses to stdout. Keeps tree-sitter parse state, call graph cache, checkpoint store, and edit history in memory.
- **LSP-aware provider interface:** Symbol resolution has a clean provider abstraction — tree-sitter is the default backend, LSP-derived data can be injected via optional `lsp_hints` fields in command JSON.
- **Plugin as bridge, not brain:** The TypeScript plugin manages binary lifecycle (spawn, health, restart), registers tools with OpenCode, and mediates LSP data. All logic lives in the Rust binary.
- **Web-first language priority:** TS/JS/TSX first (shared query patterns), then Python, then Rust and Go.
- **Binary distribution:** npm platform packages following the esbuild/turbo pattern, with `cargo install aft` fallback.
