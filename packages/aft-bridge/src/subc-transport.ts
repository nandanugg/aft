/**
 * Subconscious (subc) transport — the daemon-backed alternative to the standalone
 * NDJSON {@link BinaryBridge}. Implements the SAME {@link AftProjectTransport} /
 * {@link AftTransportPool} interfaces the plugins consume, so the entire tool /
 * hoisting / permission / UI surface stays transport-agnostic: only the ONE
 * construction site (BridgePool vs SubcTransportPool) differs.
 *
 * Standalone model: one `aft` child process per project root, session passed
 * per call. Subc model: ONE {@link SubcClient} per process (one authenticated
 * daemon connection), and a route opened+cached per `(project_root, harness,
 * session)` triple — exactly subc's {@link BindIdentity}. So the "pool" here is a
 * route cache over a single client, not N child processes.
 *
 * This module is S2 of B-FINAL: the tool-call route only. The bg_events idle-wake
 * subscription (S3) and the config gate that selects this transport (S4) build on
 * top of it. subc-client is a build-time path dependency bundled into the
 * published plugin dist; it is never a published runtime dependency.
