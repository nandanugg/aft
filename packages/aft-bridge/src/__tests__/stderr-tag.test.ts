/**
 * Regression tests for stderr line tagging in `BinaryBridge`.
 *
 * The bug we're guarding against: env_logger in the `aft` Rust child emits
 * each log line with an outer `[aft]` or `[aft-lsp]` tag based on log target.
 * Before the v0.19.1 fix, the bridge then prepended ANOTHER `[aft]` to every
 * line because the strip regex only matched `^[aft] ` and missed `[aft-lsp]`.
 * Combined with the plugin logger's `[aft-plugin]` outer wrap, LSP errors
 * rendered as `[aft-plugin] [aft] [aft-lsp] [aft] [ses_xxx] ...`.
 *
 * `tagStderrLine` is the pure helper that decides whether to prepend `[aft]`.
 * These tests pin its contract.
