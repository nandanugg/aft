 * Passive health-check commands that must NEVER count toward bridge hang

 * bridge is busy with legitimate work (a Tier-2 dead_code scan, a big grep)
 * every request queues behind it. With the default 30s timeout and a hang
 * threshold of 2, two queued `status` polls time out and SIGKILL the bridge —
 * aborting the user's in-flight request that was waiting on the very same work
 * (issue #117: "the bridge keeps getting killed" during Edit/Read).
 *
 * A passive poll is not evidence of a hung bridge — it's evidence the bridge is
 * busy. These commands therefore (1) always get `keepBridgeOnTimeout` semantics
 * regardless of caller, so a timeout rejects only that poll and never kills, and
 * (2) use a short timeout so the poll falls back to the cached snapshot fast
 * instead of blocking the full 30s twice. State transitions still push fresh
 * snapshots (1s debounce), so a dropped poll costs nothing.
