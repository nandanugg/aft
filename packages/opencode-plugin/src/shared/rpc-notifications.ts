/** Return pending notifications after acking the client's last received id.

 *  Session scoping: when `sessionId` is provided, only notifications tagged for
 *  that session (or session-less/global ones) are returned and pruned — a
 *  notification tagged for a DIFFERENT session is never handed to this client
 *  and is never pruned by this client's ack. This matters because the in-memory
 *  queue is per-process but a TUI can end up draining a process that also serves
 *  OTHER sessions: e.g. opening OpenCode Desktop on the same project starts a
 *  newer RPC server that the TUI's port discovery (newest-pid-wins) then selects,
 *  so a Desktop-session dialog action would otherwise surface in an unrelated
 *  TUI session. Each client also tracks its own `lastReceivedId`, so a global
 *  watermark prune would let session A's ack drop session B's still-unseen
 *  notification — scoping the prune to the acking session prevents that too.
 *
 *  Delivery is at-least-once (non-destructive return + prune-on-ack): a returned
 *  notification stays queued until a later call acks it via a higher
 *  `lastReceivedId`, so a lost poll response re-delivers on the next poll. */
