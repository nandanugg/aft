//! Windows-specific bash behavior. These tests run as part of the standard
//! `cargo test` suite, but their bodies are gated to `#[cfg(target_os = "windows")]`
//! so they only execute on Windows builders. On Unix builders they compile to
//! empty test bodies and pass trivially.
//!
//! Why this file exists separately from `bash_test.rs`:
//!   - The Windows shell is `powershell.exe`, not `/bin/sh`. Process spawn
//!     overhead is materially higher (typically 200-2000ms cold, vs <50ms on
//!     Unix). Issue #26 reported bash timing out at 65s; the bridge transport
//!     timeout is `max(30s, requested+5s)`, which leaves only 5s of headroom
//!     for spawn + initial read on top of the requested timeout.
//!   - PowerShell quoting differs from sh; verify our shell_command() shape
//!     handles common command syntax without escaping bugs.
//!   - The blocked_env_var() check uses case-insensitive comparison ONLY on
//!     Windows (per #[cfg(windows)] in commands/bash.rs:183) — this test
//!     locks that contract in.
